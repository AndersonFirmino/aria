# Aria Language

Aria is an expressive, interpreted, toy language built as an exercise on designing and interpreting a programming language. It has a noiseless syntax, free of useless semi colons, braces or parantheses, and treats everything as an expression. Technically, it's built with a hand written lexer and parser, a recursive decent one (Pratt), and a tree-walk interpreter. I have never set any goals for it to be either fast, nor bulletproof, so don't expect neither of them.

If features immutable variables, if and switch conditionals, functions, for loops, modules, the pipe operator, imports and many more. More importantly, it's getting expanded frequently with new features, more functions for the standard library and bug fixes. All of that while retaining it's expressiveness, clean syntax and easy of use.

```swift
let name = "aria language"
let expressive? = fn x
  if x != ""
    return "expressive " + x
  end
  "sorry, what?"
end

let pipe = name |> expressive?() |> String.capitalize()
IO.puts(pipe) // "Expressive Aria Language"
```

## Usage

If you want to play with the language, but have no interest in toying with its code, you can download a built binary for your operating system. Just head to the [latest release](https://github.com/fadion/aria/releases/latest) and download one of the archives.

The other option, where you get to play with the code and run your changes, is to `go get github.com/fadion/aria` and install it as a local binary with `go install`. Obviously, you'll need `GOROOT` in your path, but I guess you already know what you're doing.

### Run a source file

To run an Aria source file, give it a path relative to the current directory.

```
aria run path/to/file.ari
```

### REPL

As any serious language, Aria provides a REPL too:

```
aria repl
```

## Variables

Variables are as you most probably expect them but with a twist. Let's see how they're declared first:

```swift
let name = "John"
let age = 40
let married = false
```

The twist is in them being immutable. Yes, once they're declared, their value is locked in and can't be changed or redeclared. Actually, `=` doesn't even parse as an expression except for `let` statements. I'll talk more on immutability later on.

Variable names have to start with an alphabetic character and continue either with alphanumeric, underscores, questions marks or exclamation marks. When you see a question mark, don't confuse them with optionals like in some other languages. In here they have no special lexical meaning except that they allow for some nice variable names like `is_empty?` or `do_it!`.

## Data Types

Aria supports 6 data types: `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `Array` and `Dictionary`.

### String

Strings are UTF-8 encoded, meaning that you can stuff in there anything, even emojis.

```swift
let weather = "Hot"
let code = "if\nthen\t\"yes\""
let price = "å††500"
let concat = "Hello" + " " + "World"
let subscript = "aname"[2]
```

String concatenation is handled with the `+` operator but trying to concat a string with some other data type will result in a runtime error. Additionally, strings are treated as enumerables. They support subscript, iteration in `for in` loops and most of the array functions.

For the sake of it, there are some escape sequences too: \n, \t, \r, \a, \b, \f and \v. I'm sure you can figure out by yourself what every of them does.

### Integer & Float

Integers and Floats use mostly the same operators, with some minor differences. They can be used in the same expression, for example: 3 + 0.2, where the result is always cast to a Float.

Integers can be represented also as: binary with the 0b prefix, hexadecimal with the 0x prefix and octal with the 0o prefix. They'll be checked for validity at runtime.

```swift
let dec = 27
let oct = 0o33
let hex = 0x1B
let bin = 0b11011
let big = 27_000_000
let arch = 2 ** 32
let ratio = 1.61
let pi = 3.14_159_265
let sci = 0.1e3
let negsci = 25e-5
```

The underscores, a feature many modern languages are incorporating, is simply an aesthetic character that acts as a thousands separator. It is ignored in the lexing stage, so to the interpreter, `1_000_000` with `1000000` is exactly the same number. 

### Boolean

It would be strange if this data type included anything else except `true` and `false`.

```swift
let mad = true
let genius = false
```

This is a dynamic language and as and such, expressions that aren't actual Booleans may evaluate to `true` or `false`. Integers and Floats will be checked if they're equal to 0, and Strings, Arrays and Dictionaries if they're empty. These are called `truthy` expressions.

### Array

Arrays are ordered collections of any data types. You can mix and match strings with integers, or floats with other arrays.
 
 ```swift
 let multi = [5, "Hi", ["Hello", "World"]]
 let names = ["John", "Ben", 1337]
 let john = names[0]
 let concat = ["an", "array"] + ["and", "another"]
 let compare = [1, 2] == [1, 2]
 let nocomma = [5 7 9 "Hi"]
 ```
 
They support subscript with a 0-based index, combining with the `+` operator and comparison with `==` and `!=` that checks every element of both arrays for equality. Obviously, they're enumerables that can be used in `for in` loops and enumerable functions.
 
### Dictionary
 
Dictionaries are hashes with a forced string key and a value of any data type. Unlike arrays, internally their order is irrelevant, so you can't rely on index-based subscripting. They only support key-based subscripting.
 
```swift
let user = ["name": "John", "age": 40]
user["name"]
```

Just to be clear, keys should be string only. Other data types, at least for the moment, are not supported.

## Operators

You can't expect to run some calculations without a good batch of operators, right? Well, Aria has a good range of arithmetic, boolean and bitwise operators to match your needs.

By order of precedence:

```swift
Pipe: |>
Boolean: && || (AND, OR)
Bitwise: & | ~ (Bitwise AND, OR, NOT)
Equality: == != (Equal, Not equal)
Comparison: < <= > >=
Range: ..
Bitshift: << >> (Bitshift left and right)
Arithmetic: + - * / % ** (addition, substraction, multiplication, division, modulo, power)
```

Arithmetic operators can mostly be used with Integers and Floats, except for `+` in Strings for concatenation, Arrays and Dictionaries to combine. Equality operators can also be used in Strings, Arrays and Dictionaries. Comparison can also be used on Strings where it compares it's length in characters.

## Functions

Aria treats functions as first class, like any sane language should. It checks all the boxes: they can be passed to variables, as arguments to other functions, and as elements to data structures. The only thing missing for the moment are closures, meaning that a function within a function can't access the parent's variables. This doesn't allow for some interesting techniques like currying, but I'm working on it.

```swift
let add = fn x, y
  x + y
end
```

Some people may be used so much to parantheses that find it hard to read without them. For those people, I've left parantheses optional. The above function definition could be also written as `fn (x, y)`. Calling the function needs the parantheses though:

```swift
let sum = add(1335, 2)
```

The function's scope is completely isolated from the rest of the code. It can only access its own arguments and nothing else. This won't work:

```swift
let y = 8
let pow = fn x
  x ** y
end
pow(2) // Runtime error: Identifier 'y' not found in current scope
```

### Return Statement

Until now we haven't seen a single `return` statement. Functions are expressions, so the last line is considered its return value. In most cases, especially with small functions, you don't have to bother. However, there are scenarios with multiple return points that need to explicitly tell the interpreter. Let's see the classical factorial example, which is a double win as it shows recursion too.

```swift
let fac = fn n
  if n == 0
    return 1
  end
  
  n * fac(n - 1)
end
``` 

The last statement doesn't need a `return`, as it's the last line and will be automatically inferred. The `if`, on the other hand, is not, so it needs an explicit `return`. Hope it makes sense.

### Arrow Functions

Very useful when passing short functions as arguments, arrow functions provide a very clean syntax. They're handled internally exactly like normal functions. The only difference is that they're meant as a single line of code, while normal functions can handle blocks.

This normal function:

```swift
let sub = fn x
  x - 5
end
```

Is equivalent to:

```swift
let sub = (x) -> x - 5
```

They're not that useful to just spare a couple lines of code. They shine when passed as arguments:

```
Enum.map([1, 2, 3, 4], (x) -> x * 2)
Enum.reduce(1..10, 0, (x, acc) -> x + acc)
```

### Tricks

As first class, functions have their share of tricks. First, they can self-execute and return their result immediately:

```swift
let pow_2 = fn x
  x ** 2
end(2)
```

Not sure how useful, but they can be passed as elements to data structures, like arrays and dictionaries:

```swift
let add = fn x, y do x + y end
let list = [1, 2, add]
list[2](5, 7) 
```

Finally, like you may have guessed from previous examples, they can be passed as parameters to other functions:

```swift
let add = fn x, factor
  x + factor(x)
end
add(5, (x) -> x * 2)
```

## Conditionals

Aria provides two types of conditional statements. The `if/else` is limited to just an `if` and/or `else` block, without support for multiple `else if` blocks. That's because it advocates the use of the much better looking and flexible `switch` statement.

### If

An `if/else` block looks pretty familiar:

```swift
if 1 == 2
  IO.puts("Not calling me.")
else
  IO.puts("1 isn't equal to 2. Duh!")
end
```

Sometimes it's useful to inline it for simple checks:

```swift
let married = true
let free_time = if married then 0 else 100_000_000 end
```

### Switch

`Switch` expressions on the other hand are way more interesting. They can have multiple cases with multiple conditions that break automatically on each successful case, act as generic if/else, and match array elements.

```swift
let a = 5
switch a
case 2, 3
  IO.puts("Is it 2 or 3?")
case 5
  IO.puts("It is 5. Magic!")
default
  IO.puts("No idea, sorry.")
end
```

Not only that, but a `switch` can behave as a typical if/else when no control condition is provided. It basically becomes a `switch true`.

```swift
let a = "John"
switch
case a == "John"
  IO.puts("John")
case a == "Ben"
  IO.puts("Ben") 
default
  IO.puts("Nobody")
end
```

When given an array as the control condition, it will behave differently based on the cases. If the case is an array, it will compare the elements of both and run the case only if they have exact values at the same exact positions. When the case is another data type, it will hint some pattern matching behaviour by checking the elements of the array for that value. Something like this:

```swift
switch ["hello", "world"]
case "hello"
  IO.puts("hi world")
case "hi"
  IO.puts("what?")
end
```

For simplicity's sake, only `Integer`, `Float`, `String` and `Boolean` array elements are checked. Multidimensional arrays will not match.

## For Loop

There's an abundance of `for` loop variations around so Aria takes the short way: a single `for in` loop that's useful to iterate arrays, strings or dictionaries, but that does nothing else. It looks boring, but it does more than meets the eye.

```swift
for v in [1, 2, 3, 4]
  IO.puts(v)
end
```

Obviously, the result of the loop can be passed to a variable, and that's what makes them interesting to manipulate enumerables.

```swift
let plus_one = for v in [1, 2, 3, 4]
  v + 1
end
IO.puts(plus_one) // [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Passing two arguments for arrays or strings will return the current index and value. For dictionaries, the first argument will be the key.

```swift
for i, v in "abcd"
  IO.puts(i + ":" + v)
end
```

```swift
for k, v in ["name": "John", "age": 40]
  IO.puts(k)
  IO.puts(v)
end
```

With that power, you could build a function like `map` in no time:

```swift
let map = fn x, f
  for v in x
    f(v)
  end
end

let plus_one = map([1, 2, 3, 4], (x) -> x + 1)

IO.puts(plus_one) // [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The `break` and `continue` keywords, well break or skip the iteration. They function exactly like you're used to.

```swift
for i in 1..10
  if i == 5
    continue
  end
end
```

## Range Operator

The range operator is a special type of sugar to quickly generate an array of integers or strings. 

```swift
let numbers = 0..9
let huge = 999..100
let alphabet = "a".."z"
```

As it creates an enumerable, it can be put into a `for in` loop or any other function that expects an array.

```swift
for v in 10..20
  IO.puts(v)
end
```

Although its bounds are inclusive, meaning that the left and right expressions are included in the generated array, nothing stops you from doing calculations. This is completely valid:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for i in 0..Enum.size(numbers) - 1
  IO.puts(i)
end
```

## Pipe Operator

The pipe operator, inspired by [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), is a very expressive way of chaining functions calls. Instead of ugly code like the one below, where the order of operations is from the inner function to the outers ones:

```swift
subtract(pow(add(2, 1)))
```

You'll be writing beauties like this one:

```swift
add(2, 1) |> pow() |> substract()
```

The pipe starts from left to right, evaluating each left expression and passing it automatically as the first parameter to the function on the right side. Basically, the result of `add` is passed to `pow`, and finally the result of `pow` to `substract`.

It gets even more interesting when combined with standard library functions:

```swift
["hello", "world"] |> String.join(" ") |> String.capitalize()
```

Enumerable functions too:

```swift
Enum.map([1, 2, 3], (x) -> x + 1) |> Enum.filter((x) -> x % 2 == 1)

// or even nicer

[1, 2, 3] |> Enum.map((x) -> x + 1) |> Enum.filter((x) -> x % 2 == 1)
```

Such a simple operator hides so much power and flexibility into making more readable code. Almost always, if you have a chain of functions, think that they could be put into a pipe.

## Immutability

Now that you've seen most of the language constructs, it's time to fight the dragon. Enforced immutability is something you may not agree with immediately, but it makes a lot of sense the more you think about it. What you'll earn is increased clarity and programs that are easier to reason about. Sure, you'll lose some flexiblity, but it can be easily rewon.

In Aria, this won't work:

```swift
let a = 10
a = 15 // Parse error: Unexpected expression '='
```

It won't even parse, as assignement is allowed only in let statements, but not as an expression. What to do then? Very easy, just declare a new variable! The only downside to creating lots of variables, especially those derived from existing ones, is that you're allocating new memory blocks. Modern languages optimize the process by reusing parts of the existing variables, but that would be too complicated for the purpose of this language.

Iterators are typical examples where mutability is seeked for. The dreaded `i` variable shows itself in almost every language's `for` loop. Aria keeps it simple with the `for in` loop that tracks the index and value. Even if it looks like it, the index and value aren't mutable, but instead arguments to each iteration of the loop.

```swift
let numbers = [10, 5, 9]
for k, v in numbers
  IO.puts(v) 
  IO.puts(numbers[k]) // same thing
end
```

But there may be more complicated scenarios, like wanting to modify an array's values. Sure, you can do it with the `for in` loop as we've seen earlier, but higher order functions play even better:

```swift
let plus_one = Enum.map([1, 2, 3], (x) -> x + 1)
IO.puts(plus_one) // [2, 3, 4]
```

What about accumulators? Let's say you want the product of all the integer elements of an array (factorial) and obviously, you'll need a mutable variable to hold it. Fortunately we have `reduce`:

```swift
let product = Enum.reduce(1..5, 1, (x, acc) -> x * acc)
IO.puts(product)
```

All of these functions and others in the standard library can be mixed and matched to your needs. I'm sure you'll find plenty of scenarios where the current capabilities of the language can't hold up to the promise and fail to achieve something without mutable values. I'll try and fix those holes!

## Modules

Modules are very simple containers of data and nothing more. They're not an imitation of classes, as they can't be initialized, don't have any type of access control, inheritance or whatever. If you need to think in Object Oriented terms, they're like a class with only static properties and methods. They're good to give some structure to a program, but not to represent cars, trees and cats.

```swift
module Color
  let white = "#fff"
  let grey = "#666"
  let hexToRGB = fn hex
    // some calculations
  end
end

let background = Color.white
let font_color = Color.hexToRGB(Color.grey)
```

There can't be any other statement in modules except `let`, but those variables can have any expression possible. The dot syntax of calling a module property or function may remind you of classes, but still, they're not!

Keep in mind that the Aria interpreter is single pass and as such, it will only recognize calls to a module that has already been declared. 

## Imports

Source file imports are a good way of breaking down projects into smaller, easily digestible files. There's no special syntax or rules to imported files. They're included in the caller's scope and treated as if they were originally there.

```swift
// dog.ari
let name = "Charlie"
let bark_to = fn x
  "woof-woof " + x
end
```

```javascript
// main.ari
import "dog"

let phrase = name + " " + bark_to("John")
IO.puts(phrase) // "Charlie woof-woof John"
```

The file is relatively referenced from the caller and this case, both `main.ari` and `dog.ari` reside in the same folder. As the long as the extension is `.ari`, there's no need to write it in the import statement.

A more useful pattern would be to wrap imported files into a module. That would make for a more intuitive system and prevent scope leakage. The dog case above would be written simply into:

```swift
// dog.ari
module Dog
  let name = "Charlie"
  let bark_to = fn x
    "woof-woof " + x
  end
end
```

```javascript
// main.ari
import "dog"

let phrase = Dog.name + " " + Dog.bark_to("John")
```

## Comments

Nothing ground breaking in here. You can write either single line or multi line comments:

```
// an inline comment
/*
  I'm spanning multiple
  lines.
*/
```

## Standard Library

Right now it's a small library of functions, but it's expending continually. Head over to the [documentation](https://github.com/fadion/aria/wiki/Standard-Library).

## Future Plans

Although this is a language made purely for fun and experimentation, it doesn't mean I will abandon it in it's first release. Adding other features means I'll learn even more!

In the near future, hopefully, I plan to:

- Improve the Standard Library with more functions.
- Support closures and ~~recursion~~.
- ~~Add a short syntax for functions in the form of: (x) -> x~~.
- ~~Add importing of other files~~.
- ~~Add the pipe operator!~~
- Support optional values for null returns.
- Write more tests!
- Write some useful benchmarks with non-trivial programs.

## Credits

Aria was developed by Fadion Dashi, a freelance web and mobile developer from Tirana.

The implementation is based on the fantastic [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). If you're even vaguely interested in interpreters, with Golang or not, I highly suggest that book.

The `reader.Buffer` package is a "fork" of Golang's `bytes.Buffer`, in which I had to add a method that reads a rune without moving the internal cursor. I hate doing that, but unfortunately couldn't find a way out of it. That package has its own BSD-style [license](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/LICENSE).
